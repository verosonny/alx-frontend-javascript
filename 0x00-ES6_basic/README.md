ES6, or ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard, which is the scripting language specification that JavaScript is based on. It introduced several new features and improvements to the language, enhancing its readability, maintainability, and overall functionality.

New Features in ES6:

let and const: let allows you to declare block-scoped variables, and const is used to declare constants, which cannot be reassigned.
Arrow Functions: A concise syntax for writing anonymous functions, with an implicit this binding.
Template Strings: A new way to define strings using backticks (`), which allows for easy multi-line strings and string interpolation.
Destructuring Assignment: A syntax that allows you to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a more concise way.
Default Parameters: You can now provide default values for function parameters.
Rest and Spread Operators: ... is used for gathering the rest of the parameters or spreading an array into individual elements.
Classes: A more convenient and syntactic way to create constructor functions and prototype-based inheritance.
Modules: A standardized way to organize and reuse code using the import and export keywords.
Promises: A built-in way to handle asynchronous operations, providing a cleaner alternative to callback-based approaches.
Iterators and Generators: For creating iterable objects and controlling the flow of iteration.
Map and Set: New data structures for handling key-value pairs and unique values, respectively.
Constants vs. Variables:

Constants (const): Once assigned a value, cannot be re-assigned. It is block-scoped.
Variables (let): Can be re-assigned, and it is also block-scoped.
Block-Scoped Variables:

Variables declared with let and const are block-scoped, meaning their scope is limited to the block (pair of curly braces) in which they are defined.
Arrow Functions and Default Parameters:

Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions, and they capture the value of this from their surrounding context.
Default parameters allow you to assign default values to function parameters.
Rest and Spread Function Parameters:

The rest parameter (...) allows a function to accept any number of arguments as an array.
The spread operator (...) can be used to spread elements of an array or object into another array or object.
String Templating in ES6:

Template literals use backticks (`) and allow embedding expressions inside string literals, making string manipulation and concatenation more readable.
Object Creation and Properties in ES6:

Object literals can have shorthand property names, computed property names, and methods.
Destructuring assignment can be used for objects as well, allowing you to extract values into variables.
Iterators and for-of Loops:

ES6 introduces the concept of iterators and the for-of loop, providing a simpler way to iterate over iterable objects like arrays.
These features collectively contribute to making JavaScript code more expressive, modular, and easier to maintain.
